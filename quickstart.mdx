Welcome to Copilotz! This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your first Copilotz agent and integrate it with WhatsApp. By the end of this guide, you will have an AI-powered agent up and running, ready to respond to WhatsApp messages using your APIs.

## Step 1: Sign Up and Get Your API Key

To get started, you’ll need to sign up for an account and retrieve your API key. Follow these steps:

1. **Go to the Copilotz [landing page](#)**.
2. Click the **Getting Started** button at the top of the page. This will guide you through the account creation process.
3. After signing up, you’ll receive an access token (API key), which you’ll need to authenticate your API calls.
4. Your Copilotz account will automatically have access to the free sandbox environment, where you can test your integrations using a default WhatsApp number provided by Copilotz (extId: `ABC123`).

> **Note:** If you’re on the free tier, you can use the provided WhatsApp sandbox number for testing. To link your own WhatsApp number for production, you will need to subscribe to a paid plan.

## Step 2: Set Up WhatsApp Integration

Once you’ve signed up and obtained your API key, it’s time to connect your Copilotz agent to WhatsApp.

### Free Tier (Testing with Copilotz WhatsApp Number)

In the free tier, you can use Copilotz’s default WhatsApp number to test your integration:

1. Upon completing the "Getting Started" process, a **channel** resource is automatically created. This channel links a WhatsApp hook to the Copilotz testing number (extId: `ABC123`).
2. Use the `channels` resource to manage this test channel and set up the **allowList** property to control which users can send messages to this number.

Example API call to update the **allowList** for your testing channel:

```javascript
const updateChannel = async (accessToken) => {
  const channelId = 'your_channel_id';  // Channel ID created during the signup process
  const response = await fetch(`https://copilotz.com/rest/channels/${channelId}`, {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      allowList: ["5511987654321", "5511998765432"],  // List of phone numbers allowed to test the WhatsApp integration
    }),
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    console.log("Channel allowList updated successfully.");
  } else {
    console.error("Failed to update channel allowList.");
  }
};
```

Now, any phone number added to the **allowList** can send and receive messages to/from the testing WhatsApp number (`ABC123`).

### Paid Plan (Connecting Your Own WhatsApp Number)

If you’ve subscribed to a paid plan, you can link your own WhatsApp number to Copilotz. Here’s how:

1. **Click the "Connect WhatsApp" button** on the [landing page](#) or within the dashboard.
2. This will guide you through the process of registering your WhatsApp number.
3. During this process, another **channel** resource will be created, linking your registered WhatsApp number to a WhatsApp hook and callback in Copilotz.
4. After setup, your WhatsApp number is ready to receive messages through Copilotz agents.

Example API call to view the channel associated with your WhatsApp number:

```javascript
const getChannels = async (accessToken) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://copilotz.com/rest/channels", {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
  });

  const channels = await response.json();
  console.log("Your Channels:", channels);
};
```

## Step 3: Create Your First Copilotz Agent

Once WhatsApp is set up, it's time to create your first Copilotz agent. This agent can be a transcriber, chatbot, task manager, or function call handler.

Here’s how to create a simple **Chat** agent:

1. Use the **Copilotz** resource to create a new agent. This agent will interact with users over WhatsApp, responding to messages and performing actions.

Example API call to create a Copilotz agent:

```javascript
const createAgent = async (accessToken) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://copilotz.com/rest/copilotz", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: "My First Agent",
      description: "This agent will handle basic chat functionality.",
      backstory: "An AI agent to help users with common queries.",
      actions: [1, 2],  // IDs of actions this agent can perform
      job: 1,  // Job associated with this agent (e.g., Chatbot, Transcriber)
    }),
  });

  const agent = await response.json();
  console.log("Agent created:", agent);
};
```

### Key Agent Types:
- **Transcriber**: Transcribes audio messages into text.
- **Chat**: Maintains conversation context, useful for chatbots.
- **Function Call**: Executes API requests or custom functions.
- **Task Manager**: Manages workflows with multiple steps and tasks.

> **Note:** You can configure workflows for Task Manager agents, allowing them to follow specific steps to complete tasks. More details can be found in the [Workflows](#workflows) section.

## Step 4: Create an Action

Actions define what your Copilotz agents can do. For example, a **Function Call** agent might execute an API request or a **Chat** agent might send a pre-defined response to a user's query.

Example API call to create an action:

```javascript
const createAction = async (accessToken) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://copilotz.com/rest/actions", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: "Send Welcome Message",
      description: "An action that sends a welcome message to the user.",
      specType: "native:request",  // Use native 'request' module to handle API requests
      moduleUrl: "native:request",  // Native handler for API requests
      spec: "...",  // OpenAPI or custom module specs
    }),
  });

  const action = await response.json();
  console.log("Action created:", action);
};
```

## Step 5: Test in Sandbox Environment

Before moving to production, it's important to test your setup. Copilotz provides a sandbox environment where you can interact with your agents using the provided test WhatsApp number (`ABC123`).

To test:
1. Use the **allowList** to add your phone number to the test channel.
2. Send a WhatsApp message to the test number.
3. Your Copilotz agent will process the message and respond based on the actions you've configured.

## Step 6: Move to Production

When you're ready to go live with your own WhatsApp number, simply upgrade to a paid plan. Your existing agents and workflows can be linked to your production WhatsApp number, allowing you to start handling real user interactions.
