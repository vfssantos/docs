# Copilotz API Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Copilotz API** documentation! Copilotz is an AI-powered platform designed to help developers integrate intelligent agents into their applications, with a focus on WhatsApp interactions. Whether you want to build transcribers, chatbots, task managers, or API-integrating function executors, Copilotz provides you with the tools to create these agents and automate workflows seamlessly.

This documentation will guide you through everything you need to know to get started with Copilotz and unlock its full potential, from API authentication to integrating advanced workflows.

### Key Features

- **WhatsApp Integration:** Connect your agents to WhatsApp to enable AI-driven communication with your users. With Copilotz, you can link your API directly to WhatsApp through OpenAPI specs, allowing AI agents to respond to messages, handle requests, and even execute functions on behalf of users.
  
- **Multiple Agent Types:** Copilotz offers pre-built agents, each tailored for specific use cases:
  - **Transcriber:** Converts voice messages to text.
  - **Chat:** Manages ongoing conversations with users, maintaining context across messages.
  - **Function Call:** Executes API calls or custom functions based on user input, using OpenAPI specs or JavaScript modules.
  - **Task Manager:** Automates complex workflows with multiple steps and tasks, tracking progress from start to finish.

- **Flexible Workflows:** Define multi-step workflows that your agents can follow to complete tasks, whether it’s handling customer support requests, onboarding users, or any other custom business logic. Workflows can adapt based on user input or external events, and they support both success and failure paths.

- **OpenAPI Spec Integration:** Simply provide your API’s OpenAPI specification, and Copilotz will handle the rest. Your agents can use this spec to dynamically call your API, perform actions, and return results.

- **Built for Developers:** Copilotz is designed to fit seamlessly into your existing stack. Whether you’re working with REST APIs, integrating JavaScript functions, or building serverless apps, Copilotz can handle it all. The API is flexible, easy to integrate, and fully supports modern development workflows.
