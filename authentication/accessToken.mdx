The Copilotz API uses Bearer Tokens for authentication. You can get your token by authenticating via username/password in the `Login` endpoint.

You must include an Authorization header containing the bearer token in each request to the Copilotz API.

```
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

### Authentication Error Response

If an Authorization header containing the Bearer Token is missing, malformed, or invalid, you will receive an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response code.

### 500 Response

An HTTP 500 response from our servers indicates there is an unexpected error on our side. The server is usually operational within the next request. If the outage persists or you receive any other form of an HTTP 5XX error, [contact support](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/requests/new/).
